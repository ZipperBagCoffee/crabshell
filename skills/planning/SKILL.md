description: "Creates and updates structured plan documents with agent-verified execution strategy. Use when establishing an implementation plan after a discussion, or when breaking work into steps before ticketing. Invoke with /planning \"topic\" to create, or /planning P001 to update. Not for direct execution — create tickets first."

# Plan Document Skill

## Modes

- **Create mode:** `/planning "title"` — creates a new plan document
- **Update mode:** `/planning P001` — appends a log entry to an existing plan

---

## Create Mode

When argument is a title string (not a P-prefixed ID):

### Step 1: Ensure folder exists

Check if `.crabshell/plan/` exists.

- **Folder does not exist:** Create it and create `.crabshell/plan/INDEX.md` with content below.
- **Folder exists but INDEX.md does NOT exist:** Pre-existing files detected. Create `.crabshell/plan/backup/`, move ALL existing files into it, then create INDEX.md. Report to user: "Moved N existing files to .crabshell/plan/backup/"
- **Folder exists and INDEX.md exists:** Already managed. Proceed.

INDEX.md content:
```
# Plan Index

| ID | Title | Status | Created | Related | Tickets |
|----|-------|--------|---------|---------|---------|
```

### Step 2: Determine next ID

Glob `.crabshell/plan/P*.md` (exclude files matching `P\d{3}_T` pattern to avoid tickets in wrong folder).
Extract numeric part. Next ID = max + 1, zero-padded to 3 digits.
If no files exist, start at 001.

### Step 3: Create plan document

Ask the user:
1. **Intent:** What is this plan's purpose? What are the success conditions?
2. **Scope:** What's included / excluded?
3. **Plan steps:** What are the high-level steps?
4. **Verification criteria:** How do we know the plan succeeded? (Observable behavior, not "file contains X")

Then create `.crabshell/plan/P{NNN}-{slug}.md`:

```
# P{NNN} - {title}

## Intent
{user's answer}

## Scope
Included: {included}
Excluded: {excluded}

## Plan
- [ ] Step 1: {step}
- [ ] Step 2: {step}
...

## Agent Execution

This plan is executed using the following agent structure:

### Step A: Work Agent — Analysis + Plan Writing
- Analyze related code/system
- **Scope Note (from project RULES):** Conciseness applies to communication style, not to verification steps. P/O/G tables and evidence citations are required work product, not verbose output. Evidence IS the answer — "verified" without tool output is not verification. Fill Prediction before looking; fill Observation only from tool output.
- Identify dependencies and impact scope
- Write concrete execution plan
- **Document-first rule:** Write analysis results to `## Analysis Results` in the P document FIRST using Write/Edit tool. After the document is updated, provide a brief summary to the user. The document update is the primary output; the conversation summary is secondary.

### Step B: Review Agent — Plan Quality Verification
- **Independence Protocol (MANDATORY):** The Review Agent prompt MUST NOT include Work Agent's Analysis Results. Provide only: (1) Plan's Intent, Scope, and Verification Criteria sections, (2) the P/O/G template below. The Review Agent independently assesses the plan. After Review Agent completes, the Orchestrator cross-references RA findings against WA Analysis Results.
- Verify completeness and accuracy of the plan
- **Scope Note (from project RULES):** Conciseness applies to communication style, not to verification steps. P/O/G tables and evidence citations are required work product, not verbose output. Evidence IS the answer — "verified" without tool output is not verification. Fill Prediction before looking; fill Observation only from tool output.
- Review feasibility against codebase reality
- Identify risks and missing items
- **Review output MUST use Prediction/Observation/Gap format:**
  ```
  For each plan element, provide ALL THREE fields:
  | Plan Element | Prediction (from Intent + Scope) | Observation (from independent analysis) | Gap |
  |-------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----|

  Rules:
  - Prediction: derive from Intent and Scope — what SHOULD the plan address?
  - Observation: independently verify — read the relevant code/system, trace dependencies
  - Gap: where Prediction ≠ Observation, this is a finding. If Gap is always "none", you are confirming, not reviewing.
  - Evidence MUST be cited (file path, function name, specific observation from reading the code)
  ```
- **Devil's Advocate (single reviewer):** When only 1 Review Agent runs, it MUST include a Devil's Advocate section articulating the strongest counter-argument to its own conclusions.
- **Document-first rule:** Write review results to `## Review Results` in the P document FIRST using Write/Edit tool. After the document is updated, provide a brief summary to the user. The document update is the primary output; the conversation summary is secondary.

### Step C: Orchestrator — Intent Check (Critical Evaluation)
- Compare against D document's Intent Anchor (IA)
- Confirm plan has not deviated from original intent
- Verify plan coherence: do the plan steps work together as a whole? Individual steps may each be sound, but combined they may have ordering issues, dependency conflicts, or scope gaps. The plan must be coherent as a system, not just individually valid steps.
  **Coherence verification methods (minimum 2 of the following):**
  - **Cross-file sync check:** When the same concept appears across planned target files, grep for the concept and confirm consistent wording/semantics.
  - **Reference integrity:** When plan steps reference content across files, verify the reference targets will hold after changes.
  - **Contradiction scan:** Check for conflicting plan steps or contradictory instructions between planned changes.
  - **Pipeline contradiction scan:** Check whether this change contradicts logic in related pipelines. Level 1: within the changed files. Level 2: in files that interact with the changed component (imports, callers, shared state). Level 3: against project rules/philosophy (CLAUDE.md, SKILL.md principles). A change that works locally but contradicts a related pipeline is not coherent.
  "Coherent" one-liner without method execution = INVALID.
- **Evidence Gate (BLOCKING — check BEFORE evaluating content):**
  Review Agents generate text that looks like analysis without actual investigation. Your gate exists to catch this.
  □ Does each plan element review have Prediction, Observation, AND Gap fields?
  □ Does Observation contain evidence from independent analysis? (file paths, function names, specific code observations)
  □ Is Prediction ≠ Observation check performed? (rubber-stamp detection)
  □ For items where Gap = "none": is the justification substantive?
  → If ANY check fails: REJECT Review Agent results and request re-review
- Identify at least ONE risk, gap, or concern in the plan (even if approving). "No concerns" requires 3+ sentences of justification referencing specific aspects examined.
- Decide to approve or reject with substantive reasoning
- **Document-first rule:** Write intent check results to `## Intent Check` in the P document FIRST using Write/Edit tool. After the document is updated, provide a brief summary to the user. The document update is the primary output; the conversation summary is secondary.

## Tickets
(Automatically recorded when tickets are created)

## Analysis Results (Work Agent)
(placeholder — Orchestrator: if still placeholder after Step A, write WA results here)

## Review Results (Review Agent)
(placeholder — Orchestrator: if still placeholder after Step B, write RA results here)

## Intent Check (Orchestrator)
(placeholder — Orchestrator: if still placeholder after Step C, write intent check here)

## Verification Criteria
{user's answer — must describe observable behavior}

## Log

---
### [{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}] Created
{background/motivation for this plan}
```

### Step 4: Update INDEX.md

Append row to `.crabshell/plan/INDEX.md`:

```
| P{NNN} | {title} | draft | {YYYY-MM-DD} | | |
```

### Step 5: Confirm

Tell user: "Created P{NNN} in draft status. Review and approve before creating tickets."

---

## Update Mode

When argument matches `P\d{3}` pattern:

### Step 1: Read existing document

Glob `.crabshell/plan/P{NNN}-*.md`. If not found, stop.

### Step 2: Append log entry

Append to end of document:

```

---
### [{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}] {entry_type}
{content}
```

Entry types:
- General update (default)
- `Approved` — user approved the plan
- `Status change: {old} → {new}`
- `Ticket added: P{NNN}_T{NNN}` — when a ticket is created (auto-appended by ticketing skill)

### Step 3: Update INDEX.md if needed

Update status column and/or Tickets column in `.crabshell/plan/INDEX.md`.

### Status Transitions

- `draft` → `approved` (user approves — REQUIRED before tickets)
- `approved` → `in-progress` (first ticket starts work)
- `in-progress` → `done` (all tickets verified)
- any → `abandoned`

---

## Rules

1. **NEVER modify existing content.** Only append to Log section, Tickets section, and agent result sections (Analysis Results, Review Results, Intent Check).
2. **Tickets section:** Only receives appended lines like `- P{NNN}_T{NNN}: {title}` when ticketing skill creates a ticket.
3. **Plan checkboxes:** Never modify. Progress is tracked in Log entries.
4. **INDEX.md** is the only file where status may be modified.
5. When plan comes from a discussion/investigation, note `D{NNN}` or `I{NNN}` in INDEX.md Related column and add to first log entry.
6. **No parent transition while children incomplete:** P can only transition to `done` when ALL related tickets are `verified`. If any ticket is incomplete, refuse `done` transition.
7. **Auto-conclude parent on completion:** When P becomes `done` → automatically update D/I in Related column to `concluded` and append log to those documents. (Triggered by ticketing cascade)
8. **Mandatory work log:** After performing any work related to this document, append a log entry to the Log section using the existing format (`### [{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}] {entry_type}`). This applies regardless of whether this skill was explicitly invoked — if the work touched or advanced this plan's purpose, log it.
9. **Mandatory verification result append + Orchestrator fallback:** Work Agent, Review Agent, and Orchestrator MUST append their execution results to the corresponding sections of the P document (Analysis Results, Review Results, Intent Check). Verbal reporting alone is insufficient — verification not recorded in the document is equivalent to verification not performed. **Orchestrator document check:** After each agent step (A, B, C), the Orchestrator MUST Read the P document and verify the corresponding section no longer contains "placeholder". If it does, the Orchestrator MUST use Edit to write the agent's results into that section before proceeding to the next step.
10. **Exhaustive verification standard:** Verification follows the VERIFICATION-FIRST principle in RULES (Predict → Execute → Compare). When no project verification tool exists, invoke the 'verifying' skill. Direct → indirect → explicitly "unverified".
11. **Anti-partitioning (regressing context):** When this plan is part of a regressing cycle, it MUST plan work for the current cycle only. Plans that reference or pre-allocate work for future cycles (e.g., "Cycle 2 will handle X") are INVALID and must be rejected by the Review Agent and Orchestrator.
12. **Regressing state update:** If `.crabshell/memory/regressing-state.json` exists and is active, update it after plan creation using: `"{NODE_PATH}" -e "const f='{PROJECT_DIR}/.crabshell/memory/regressing-state.json';const s=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(f,'utf8'));s.planId='{P-ID}';s.lastUpdatedAt=new Date().toISOString();require('fs').writeFileSync(f,JSON.stringify(s,null,2))"`. Phase transition is handled automatically by the PostToolUse hook. Only applies when regressing-state.json exists — standalone planning usage is unaffected.
