name: save-memory
description: "Manually saves the current session context to memory files on demand. Use when explicitly asked to save progress, or when important decisions need to be preserved immediately rather than waiting for auto-save. Invoke with /save-memory. Not for routine saves — memory-autosave handles those automatically via triggers."

## Project Root Resolution

**IMPORTANT:** Get the project root from your context's "Project Root Anchor" section.
Look for: `Your ACTUAL project root is: <path>`

Use this value as `{PROJECT_DIR}` in all commands below.
If not available in context, use your current working directory.

# Save Memory

Force immediate save of session memory.

## Usage

```
/memory-keeper:save-memory
```

## Actions

1. **Save to memory.md:**
```bash
printf '\n## %s\n%s\n' "$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H%M)" "[Summary of current session progress]" >> "{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/memory/memory.md"
```

2. **Create session file:**
```bash
cat > "{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/memory/sessions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H%M).md" << 'ENDSESSION'
# Session TIMESTAMP

## Notes

- Use when you want to checkpoint progress mid-session
